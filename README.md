Hello, I'm @kleekawaii!

**How fortunate to meet you in this vast world!**

I am an undergraduate as mentioned in Bio below the avatar. Despite a newcomer to computer science, I believe that a brilliant future is waiting for me with my continuous efforts. Now, please let me have a few minutes to talk about myself.

+ My favorite programming language is C++ for its flexibility and powerful features. As an undergraduate who has a definite distance to go from industry, I have a focus on versatility and performance. Of course, I prefer Java and Python for daily usage or development.

+ I have a strong curiosity in computer science, mathematics and philosophy-related subjects, particularly interested in algebra in mathematics. I firmly believe that mathematics and philosophy provide us with a more abstract but clear and powerful way to describe and understand the world we are living in, and they may help out problems when designing programs as well.

+ Out of my curiosity in lierature and Chinese history, I once read plenty of Chinese ancient classics. They have brought me a new disscusion of Chinese culture, society and politics. I hope that I could cotinue it during my journey exploring computer science!

+ Character in my avatar, Klee, comes form *Genshin Impact* which I barely play now, but her quality, optimist and warmth did leave a remarkable impression on me. Thus, I choose her as my avatar and my mailbox is also named with her. ~~Not lolicon, absolutely!~~
